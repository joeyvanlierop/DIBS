# DIBS

Do you have a honourable friend group who respects each others dibs? Neither do I.

**D**efend **I**tems from **B**eing **S**tolen (DIBS) is the perfect way to keep your friend group intact. No longer will you call dibs on an chest, only for Max to steal it 2 seconds later and blame it on Discord delay.

## Usage

To place dibs on an object, all you need to do is ping it. You will hear a locking sound, and the object will be surrounded by tendrils. There are 4 rules that follow:
1. Only you can purchase the object that you have dibs on
2. You cannot have dibs on more that one object at once
3. Your dibs will be cleared once you have purchased the object
4. You cannot purchase anything else until you have cleared your dibs

If something goes wrong, type `undibs` in chat and all of the dibs will be cleared. Just know that if you do this to steal my item, you are a bad person.
